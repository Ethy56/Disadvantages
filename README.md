## Disadvantages
A plugin to give a team a disadvantage for more even gameplay.

Do you ever play a match and think. Gosh how is this player getting 8-0'd within a minute? Well this plugin is your answer!

The basic idea of Disadvantages is too make the game more fair for those lovely plats who try to beat ssls. Disadvantages allows you to make one team (or both if your really evil) get stopped (the velocity of their car is set to 0). That's not all, with the interval slider you can change how much the team(s) get stopped. The lower the value, the more the plugin will stop the players of that team.
